<h1>I. THE NATURE OF THE FEELING OF CERTAINTY</h1>

The general method here was, of course, the method of <b>introspection</b>. Situations were created about which the subject might be expected to[Pg 278] make judgments with different sorts or different degrees of certainty, if such should be possible. He was then questioned as to his experience. The method has the fault of all introspective methods, viz., its results can in no case be verified. The results here are none the less suggestive, and, for the second <i>problem</i>, at any rate, definite enough to be convincing.

Most of the experiments were conducted in connection with visual fields. In working at the first <i>problem</i> which we have now to consider, however, the certainty connected with the dermal sensations and that connected with the simple reasoning process of addition were also examined. The apparatus used consisted of three sets of cards. On one set were pasted geometrical shapes cut from colored paper, and black and white letters or figures. Each of these cards was shown to a subject for a second and a half, or two seconds. After the exposure he told what he judged to be on the card, giving all that he could about the nature of his feeling of confidence (or certainty) for each judgment. On the second set of cards square pieces of tin, smooth rubber, rough rubber, cotton, felt, undressed kid, leather, eiderdown, flannel, coarse and fine sandpaper, and pricked paper were stuck, six on each card. The experimenter passed these cards so that these bits of material rubbed against the forefinger of the subject, while a curtain kept the card and the hand hidden from the subject's sight. Here, again, the subject judged of what had been on the card, just as he had done after seeing each of the first set of cards. Small sample cards, each having pasted upon it a piece of one of the substances used, were also behind the curtain, and the subject was allowed to feel of these as much as he wished while giving his report. Such sample cards were required because of the underdevelopment of the association of names of any kind with the dermal sensations. A single card with three groups of figures for addition upon it made up the third part of the apparatus. Here the subject was asked first to add the columns rapidly and to introspect as to his certainty of the correctness of the different results; then to go over the addition again, and yet a third time, and to compare his feelings of certainty in the different cases. The introspection was developed partly through the help of questions put by the experimenter, but in asking these questions great care was taken to prevent their influencing the judgment of the subject. Some observations made by the subjects during the second division of the experiment (also conducted in connection with visual fields) are, also, introduced here. Apart from this, the experiments on the feeling of certainty connected with this sense of sight were greater in number than the other experiments;<small>[Pg 279]</small> and it is those that have given us most of the data for answering the second and third problems.

The subjects did not agree in their <i>answers</i> to the first <i>problem</i>. Some found not only that the certainty connected with their belief in the results of their addition seemed to be of a distinct type from that connected immediately with the sense of sight, but also that there were different sorts of certainty connected immediately with the sense of sight itself. Others found but one kind of a feeling of certainty. All agreed, however, that so far as the kind or kinds of certainty associated with them was concerned there was no difference between the sense of sight and the dermal senses, so that it would seem to be true that any distinctions which are to be found within the feeling of certainty will not be distinctions springing from the difference in the sense-organs. Within the sense of sight, however, subjects B, E, and F divided their feelings of certainty into two classes,â€”an absolute feeling of certainty which they felt could not be shaken, and a feeling of confidence which they would act upon but which they felt might be shaken by questioning, and which seemed different by more than degree from the feeling of certainty proper. Subjects A, C, K and H found no such marked distinction between their feeling of greatest certainty and all lesser feelings of conviction. Subject D at one time felt that the distinction into two such distinct classes, the definitely certain and the more wavering, fitted his experience, and at another time said that it seemed to him that each degree of conviction stood for an unique feeling of certainty and that any two of them were as different from each other as any other two. A second division of the feelings of certainty into two classes is to be found with subjects A, F and H. This developed in connection with the visual experiments again. The distinction here may be called one into psychological and logical certainty. The latter rests on reasoning either from the probable character of the field, or from a feeling as to its general character, to the nature of some detail. We shall notice the characteristics of these two classes later. One subject, A, further distinguished as different the feelings of certainty connected with the two methods of logical certainty just given. The others made no such distinctions. In the experiment with the columns for addition only six subjects, A, B, C, D, F, and K took part. Of these the two who had made the distinction into psychological and logical certainty with the visual experiments (subjects A and F) again made the same distinction. Subject F, however, who had had occasion to do a good deal of important work with statistics, found practically no element of logical certainty in connection with his addition, though it[Pg 280] seemed to him that what confidence he felt in his result should be distinguished from the psychological certainty he had had as to the character of the visual fields. Subject B felt no certainty in her results except as she could so hold the process together as to have what seemed to her a simultaneous experience. When she had to judge of the results of a set of successive experiences that could not be so unified, she characterized her state of consciousness not as holding a feeling of certainty or of uncertainty, but as simply lacking any feeling of certainty. The other three subjects found no difference between the feelings of certainty and uncertainty associated with visual experiences and those associated with the process of addition. As a whole, it seems then that we must answer our first <i>problem</i> by saying that the case seems to be different with different individuals. With some the highest grade of certainty associated with a sense-experience is sharply distinct from the other grades, and with some again there appear at least the two general classes of psychological and logical certainty. On the other hand, there seem to be people for whom the feeling of certainty has no such sharp distinctions of kind within it.

The results as to the second <i>problem</i> may be more briefly and more distinctly given. No subject found any evidence that the number of the grades of certainty which he could distinguish would be limited by anything except his keenness in introspection, although in the simple tests given for the experiment, four was the greatest number of grades distinguished at any one time. Two of the subjects (B and F), who set the highest grade of certainty apart from the judgments made with lesser confidence, said that there might be degrees within that higher grade as well as among the <i>"uncertainties."</i> There was no evidence that logical certainty differed from psychological in respect of the grades to be found within it, and some evidence that they were alike in that respect, although logical certainty was less carefully examined. It would seem, then, that our second <i>problem</i> is to be answered thus: There are degrees present in some if not in all kinds of certainty, and there is no evidence that the number of these degrees is limited.
